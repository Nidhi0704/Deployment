# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗💸

This project predicts the price of a car based on various features provided by the user. Using regression models, data cleaning, preprocessing, and a range of machine learning techniques, this project achieves high accuracy, giving users an enhanced experience when estimating car prices.

## Features ✨
- **User-friendly Interface**: Users can input features like car model, year, mileage, and more to get an accurate price prediction.
- **High Accuracy**: By utilizing regression models, we provide highly accurate predictions.
- **Data Science Workflow**: The project covers the entire data science process, including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Workflow 🔄

### 1. Data Collection
We started with a dataset that contains various features of cars such as:
- Car model
- Year of manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- And other features

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧹
- Handled missing data by filling in appropriate values or removing incomplete entries.
- Standardized features to ensure consistency in model training.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical values using one-hot encoding.

### 3. Model Building 🛠️
We used various regression techniques to build the prediction model:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

### 4. Model Evaluation 📊
- Achieved high accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the model on test data using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Cross-Validation.

### 5. Deployment 🌐
- A Flask web application was created to interact with users.
- Users can input car features, and the model provides a predicted car price.
